<h1>Coffee Bean Oil</h1>
                <p> Medium to Dark Brownish Green with a crispy herbal scent that is made from cold pressing unroasted Arabica coffee beans. It does not smell like brewed coffee or coffee essential oil. For use on body and hair. • Contains a high level of chlorogenic acid, which is a powerful antioxidant
                and significant amounts of fatty acids and phytosterols which promote excellent moisture retention and rapid skin penetration. Coffee bean oil is safe to use on any skin type since it has the same pH level as human skin and is very similar to the natural oils found in the human body. • Helps break down fat and smoothens swollen areas of skin thus, reducing the appearance of cellulite. • For its anti-inflammatory properties coffee oil has been used in eye creams and serums to diminish puffiness, reverses photoaging, fine lines, and wrinkles. • Helps to control symptoms of skin disorders such as sores, itchiness, scaling and dead cell build up. It contains enzymes that stimulate detoxification and helps in cleaning the skin, thus making it ideal to help skin prone to acne. • It has a high content of flavonoids which protect the skin against UV rays as well as help in the treatment of injuries caused by excessive sun exposure. • Contains naturally occurring vitamins and fatty acids to encourage natural collagen and elastin for younger looking skin. • Coffee Oil has an extremely light and silky feel. Repairs dry and damaged hair and gives it a non-greasy shiny glow For external use only How to use Packaging: Dark amber glass bottle extends the shelf life as oils are light sensitive and must be stored in dark amber bottles to protect them from oxidation. (Pure natural oils that are not packaged in dark bottles will lose potency and become ineffective.)
